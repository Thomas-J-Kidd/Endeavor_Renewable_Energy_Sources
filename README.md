# Endeavor_Renewable_Energy_Sources
Data collection for Oklahoma State University at the Endeavor building


Run data_collection.py to collect data from all 4 controllers simultanously. 


The feather files are just light csv files. You can change them to csv but you will have to change the main python code to read and save to a csv file as well. Furthermore this must be connected to the 4 different controlers through the ethernet switch.
